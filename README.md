# Contour-Detection-and-Shape-Approximation
This project focuses on contour detection and shape approximation in images using OpenCV and Python. The primary goal is to identify the boundaries of objects within an image and approximate their shapes, providing valuable insights for applications in computer vision, image processing, and object recognition.
